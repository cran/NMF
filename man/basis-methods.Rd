\title{ Get/Set the matrix factors in a NMF model }
\description{
 \code{basis} and \code{basis<-} are S4 generic functions which respectively 
 extract and set the matrix of basis vectors (i.e. the first matrix factor) 
 of a NMF model. 
 For example, in the case of the standard NMF model \eqn{V \equiv WH}, 
 method \code{basis} will return matrix \eqn{W}.
 
 \code{coef} and \code{coef<-} are S4 methods defined for the associated generic 
 functions from package \code{stats} (See \link[stats]{coef}). 
 They respectively extract and set the matrix of mixture coefficients 
 (i.e. the second matrix factor) of a NMF model. 
 For example, in the case of the standard NMF model \eqn{V \equiv WH}, 
 method \code{coef} will return matrix \eqn{H}.
 
 Methods \code{coefficients} and \code{coefficients<-} are simple aliases for methods 
 \code{coef} and \code{coef<-} respectively.
