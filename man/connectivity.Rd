\usage{
  connectivity(object, ...)

  \S4method{connectivity}{NMF}(object, no.attrib = FALSE)

  consensus(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{an object with a suitable
  \code{\link{predict}} method.}

  \item{...}{extra arguments to allow extension. They are
  passed to \code{\link{predict}}, except for the
  \code{vector} and \code{factor} methods.}

  \item{no.attrib}{a logical that indicates if attributes
  containing information about the NMF model should be
  attached to the result (\code{TRUE}) or not
  (\code{FALSE}).}
}
\value{
  a square matrix of dimension the number of samples in the
  model, full of 0s or 1s.
}
\description{
  \code{connectivity} is an S4 generic that computes the
  connectivity matrix based on the clustering of samples
  obtained from a model's \code{\link{predict}} method.

  The consensus matrix has been proposed by \cite{Brunet et
  al. (2004)} to help visualising and measuring the
  stability of the clusters obtained by NMF approaches. For
  objects of class \code{NMF} (e.g. results of a single NMF
  run, or NMF models), the consensus matrix reduces to the
  connectivity matrix.
}
\details{
  The connectivity matrix of a given partition of a set of
  samples (e.g. given as a cluster membership index) is the
  matrix \eqn{C} containing only 0 or 1 entries such that:
  \deqn{C_{ij} = \left\{\begin{array}{l} 1\mbox{ if sample
  }i\mbox{ belongs to the same cluster as sample }j\\
  0\mbox{ otherwise} \end{array}\right..}{ C_{ij} = 1 if
  sample i belongs to the same cluster as sample j, 0
  otherwise}
}
\section{Methods}{
  \describe{

  \item{connectivity}{\code{signature(object = "ANY")}:
  Default method which computes the connectivity matrix
  using the result of \code{predict(x, ...)} as cluster
  membership index. }

  \item{connectivity}{\code{signature(object = "factor")}:
  Computes the connectivity matrix using \code{x} as
  cluster membership index. }

  \item{connectivity}{\code{signature(object = "numeric")}:
  Equivalent to \code{connectivity(as.factor(x))}. }

  \item{connectivity}{\code{signature(object = "NMF")}:
  Computes the connectivity matrix for an NMF model, for
  which cluster membership is given by the most
  contributing basis component in each sample. See
  \code{\link{predict,NMF-method}}. }

  \item{consensus}{\code{signature(object = "NMFfitX")}:
  Pure virtual method defined to ensure \code{consensus} is
  defined for sub-classes of \code{NMFfitX}. It throws an
  error if called. }

  \item{consensus}{\code{signature(object = "NMF")}: This
  method is provided for completeness and is identical to
  \code{\link{connectivity}}, and returns the connectivity
  matrix, which, in the case of a single NMF model, is also
  the consensus matrix. }

  \item{consensus}{\code{signature(object = "NMFfitX1")}:
  The result is the matrix stored in slot
  \sQuote{consensus}. This method returns \code{NULL} if
  the consensus matrix is empty.

  See \code{\link{consensus,NMFfitX1-method}} for more
  details. }

  \item{consensus}{\code{signature(object = "NMFfitXn")}:
  This method returns \code{NULL} on an empty object. The
  result is a matrix with several attributes attached, that
  are used by plotting functions such as
  \code{\link{consensusmap}} to annotate the plots.

  See \code{\link{consensus,NMFfitXn-method}} for more
  details. }
