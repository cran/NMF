\description{
  These functions enable mixing base and grid graphics in
  \code{\link{aheatmap}}, by avoiding calls to the grid
  internal function \code{'L_gridDirty'}. They are not
  exported (i.e. not tampering core functions) and are only
  meant for internal use within the \pkg{NMF} package.

  \code{current.vpPath_patched} aims at substituting
  \code{\link[grid]{current.vpPath}}, so that the graphic
  engine is not reset. This is essentially to prevent
  outputting a blank page at the beginning of PDF graphic
  engines.

  \code{.use.grid.patch} tells if the user enabled patching
  grid.
}
\details{
  \code{tryViewport} tries to go down to a viewport in the
  current tree, given its name.

  \code{tryViewport} uses \code{\link[grid]{grid.ls}} and
  not \code{\link{seekViewport}} as the latter would reset
  the graphic device and break the mix grid/base graphic
  capability.
