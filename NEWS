*************************************************************************

NEW FEATURES

    o Part of the code has been optimised in C++ for speed and memory efficiency:
        
        - the multiplicative updates for reducing the KL divergence and the euclidean 
        distance have been optimised in C++. This significantly reduces the 
        computation time of the methods that make use of them: 'lee', 'brunet', 
        'offset', 'nsNMF' and 'lnmf'.
        Old R version of the algorithm are still accessible with the suffix '.R#'. 
        
        - the computation of euclidean distance and KL divergence are implemented 
        in C++, and do not require the duplication of the original matrices as done 
        in R.

    o Generic 'dimnames' is now defined for objects of class 'NMF' and returns
	a list with 3 elements: the row names of the basis matrix, the column names 
    of the mixture coefficient matrix , and the column names of the basis matrix. 
	This implies that methods 'rownames' and 'columnames' are also available for 
	'NMF' objects.
	
    o A new class structure has been developed to handle the results of multiple 
	NMF runs in a cleaner and more structured way:
	
        - Class 'NMFfitX' defines a common interface for multiple NMF runs of a 
	      single algorithm.

        - Class 'NMFfitX1' handles the sub-case where only the best fit is returned.
	      In particular, this class allows to handle such results as if coming 
	      from a single run.

        - Class 'NMFfitXn' handles the sub-case where the list of all the fits 
	      is returned. 

        - Class 'NMFList' handles the case of heterogeneous NMF runs (different 
	      algorithms, different factorization rank, different dimension, etc...)
	      
    o The vignette contains more examples and details about the use of package.

    o The package is compatible with both versions 3.x and 4.x of the bigmemory
    package. This package is used when running multicore parallel computations. 
    With version 4.x of bigmemory, the synchronicity package is also required as 
    it provides the mutex functionality that used to be provided by bigmemory 3.x.

BUG FIX
    
    o Running in multicore mode from the GUI on MacOS X is not allowed anymore as 
    it is not safe and were throwing an error ['The process has forked and ...'].
    Thanks to Stephen Henderson from the UCL Cancer Institute (UK) for reporting this.
    
    o Function 'nmf' now restores the random seed to its original value as before its call 
    with a numeric seed. This behaviour can be disabled with option 'restore.seed=FALSE' or '-r'

NEWLY DEPRECATED CLASSES, METHODS, FUNCTIONS, DATA SETS

    o Deprecated Generics/Methods
       1) 'errorPlot' - S4 generic/methods remains with .Deprecated message.
       It is replaced by a definition of the 'plot' method for signatures 
       'NMFfit,missing' and 'NMFList,missing'
       It will be completely removed from the package in the next version.
       
    o Deprecated Class
       1) 'NMFSet' - S4 class remains for backward compatibility, but is not 
       used anymore. It is replaced by the classes 'NMFfitX1', 'NMFfitXn', 
       'NMFList'.

*************************************************************************
*                       Changes in version 0.3                          *
*************************************************************************

NEW FEATURES

    o Now requires R 2.10
	
    o New list slot 'misc' in class 'NMF' to be able to define new NMF models, 
	without having to extend the S4 class. Access is done by methods '$' and '$<-'.
	
    o More robust and convenient interface 'nmf'
	
    o New built-in algorithm : PE-NMF [Zhang (2008)]
	
    o The vignette and documentation have been enriched with more examples and 
	details on the functionalities.
	
    o When possible the computation is run in parallel on all the available cores.
	See option 'p' or 'parallel=TRUE' in argument '.options' of function 'nmf'.
	
    o Algorithms have been optimized and run faster
	
    o Plot for rank estimation: quality measure curves can be plotted together 
	with a set of reference measures.
	The reference measures could for example come from the rank estimation of 
	randomized data, to investigate overfitting.
	
    o New methods '$' and '$<-' to access slot 'extra' in class 'NMFfit'
	These methods replace method 'extra' that is now defunct.
	
    o Function 'randomize' allows to randomise a target matrix or 
	'ExpressionSet' by permuting the entries within each columns using a
	different permutation for each column. It is useful when checking for
    over-fitting. 
		
CHANGES

    o The 'random' method of class 'NMF' is renamed 'rnmf', but is still 
	accessible through name 'random' via the 'seed' argument in the 
	interface method 'nmf'. 
	
NEWLY DEFUNCT CLASSES, METHODS, FUNCTIONS, DATA SETS

    o Defunct Generics/Methods
       1) 'extra' - S4 generic/methods remains with .Defunct message.
       It will be completely removed from the package in the next version.

*************************************************************************
*                       Changes in version 0.2.4                        *
*************************************************************************

CHANGES
	
    o Class 'NMFStrategy' has a new slot 'mixed', that specify if the algorithm 
	can handle mixed signed input matrices.
	
    o Method 'nmf-matrix,numeric,function' accepts a new parameter 'mixed' to 
	specify if the custom algorithm can handle mixed signed input matrices.

*************************************************************************
*                       Changes in version 0.2.3                        *
*************************************************************************

NEW FEATURES

    o Package 'Biobase' is not required anymore, and only suggested.
    The definition and export of the NMF-BioConductor layer is done at 
    loading.

    o 'nmfApply' S4 generic/method: a 'apply'-like method for objects of 
    class 'NMF'.
    
    o 'predict' S4 method for objects of class 'NMF': the method replace the now
    deprecated 'clusters' method.
    
    o 'featureNames' and 'sampleNames' S4 method for objects of class 'NMFSet'.
    
    o sub-setting S4 method '[' for objects of class 'NMF': row subsets are 
    applied to the rows of the basis matrix, column subsets are applied to 
    the columns of the mixture coefficient matrix.

CHANGES
	
    o method 'featureScore' has a new argument 'method' to allow choosing between 
	different scoring schema.
	
    o method 'extractFeatures' has two new arguments: 'method' allows choosing 
	between different scoring and selection methods; 'format' allows to specify 
	the output format.
	NOTE: the default output format has changed. The default result is now a 
	list whose elements are integer vectors (one per basis component) that 
	contain the indices of the basis-specific features. It is in practice what 
    one is usually interested in.  

BUG FIXES

    o Methods 'basis<-' and 'coef<-' were not exported by file NAMESPACE.
    
    o Method 'featureNames' was returning the column names of the mixture 
    coefficient matrix, instead of the row names of the basis matrix.
    
    o 'metaHeatmap' with argument 'class' set would throw an error.

NEWLY DEPRECATED CLASSES, METHODS, FUNCTIONS, DATA SETS

    o Deprecated Generics/Methods
       1) clusters - S4 generic/methods remain with .Deprecated message
