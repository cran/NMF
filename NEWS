CHANGES
	
	o Class 'NMFStrategy' has a new slot 'mixed', that specify if the algorithm 
	can handle mixed signed input matrices.
	
	o Method 'nmf-matrix,numeric,function' accepts a new parameter 'mixed' to 
	specify if the custom algorithm can handle mixed signed input matrices.

NEW FEATURES

    o Package 'Biobase' is not required anymore, and only suggested.
    The definition and export of the NMF-BioConductor layer is done at 
    loading.

    o 'nmfApply' S4 generic/method: a 'apply'-like method for objects of 
    class 'NMF'.
    
    o 'predict' S4 method for objects of class 'NMF': the method replace the now
    deprecated 'clusters' method.
    
    o 'featureNames' and 'sampleNames' S4 method for objects of class 'NMFSet'.
    
    o sub-setting S4 method '[' for objects of class 'NMF': row subsets are 
    applied to the rows of the basis matrix, column subsets are applied to 
    the columns of the mixture coefficient matrix.

CHANGES
	
	o method 'featureScore' has a new argument 'method' to allow choosing between 
	different scoring schema.
	
	o method 'extractFeatures' has two new arguments: 'method' allows choosing 
	between different scoring and selection methods; 'format' allows to specify 
	the output format.
	NOTE: the default output format has changed. The default result is now a 
	list whose elements are integer vectors (one per basis component) that 
	contain the indices of the basis-specific features. It is in practice what 
	one is usually interested in.  

BUG FIXES

    o Methods 'basis<-' and 'coef<-' were not exported by file NAMESPACE.
    
    o Method 'featureNames' was returning the column names of the mixture 
    coefficient matrix, instead of the row names of the basis matrix.
    
    o 'metaHeatmap' with argument 'class' set would throw an error.

NEWLY DEPRECATED CLASSES, METHODS, FUNCTIONS, DATA SETS

    o Deprecated Generics/Methods
       1) clusters - S4 generic/methods remain with .Deprecated message
